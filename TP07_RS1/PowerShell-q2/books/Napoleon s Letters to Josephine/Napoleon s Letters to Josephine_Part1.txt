PREFACE


I have no apology to offer for the subject of this book, in view of
Lord Rosebery's testimony that, until recently, we knew nothing about
Napoleon, and even now "prefer to drink at any other source than the
original."

"Study of Napoleon's utterances, apart from any attempt to discover
the secret of his prodigious exploits, cannot be considered as lost
time." It is then absolutely necessary that we should, in the words of
an eminent but unsympathetic divine, know something of the "domestic
side of the monster," first hand from his own correspondence,
confirmed or corrected by contemporaries. There is no master mind that
we can less afford to be ignorant of. To know more of the doings of
Pericles and Aspasia, of the two Cæsars and the Serpent of old Nile,
of Mary Stuart and Rizzio, of the Green Faction and the Blue, of
Orsini and Colonna, than of the Bonapartes and Beauharnais, is worthy
of a student of folklore rather than of history.

Napoleon was not only a King of Kings, he was a King of Words and of
Facts, which "are the sons of heaven, while words are the daughters of
earth," and whose progeny, the Genii of the Code, still dominates
Christendom.[1] In the hurly-burly of the French War, on the chilling
morrow of its balance-sheet, in the Janus alliance of the Second
Empire, we could not get rid of the nightmare of the Great Shadow.
Most modern works on the Napoleonic period (Lord Rosebery's "Last
Phase" being a brilliant exception) seem to be (1) too long, (2) too
little confined to contemporary sources. The first fault, especially
if merely discursive enthusiasm, is excusable, the latter pernicious,
for, as Dr. Johnson says of Robertson, "You are sure he does not know
the people whom he paints, so you cannot suppose a likeness.
Characters should never be given by a historian unless he knew the
people whom he describes, _or copies from those who knew him_."

Now, if ever, we must _fix_ and _crystallise_ the life-work of
Napoleon for posterity, for "when an opinion has once become popular,
very few are willing to oppose it. Idleness is more willing to credit
than inquire ... and he that writes merely for sale is tempted to
court purchasers by flattering the prejudices of the public."[2] We
have accumulated practically all the evidence, and are not yet so
remote from the aspirations and springs of action of a century ago as
to be out of touch with them. The Vaccination and Education questions
are still before us; so is the cure of croup and the composition of
electricity. We have special reasons for sympathy with the first
failures of Fulton, and can appreciate Napoleon's primitive but
effective expedients for modern telegraphy and transport, which were
as far in advance of his era as his nephew's ignorance of railway
warfare in 1870 was behind it. We must admire The Man[3] who found
within the fields of France the command of the Tropics, and who needed
nothing but time to prosper Corsican cotton and Solingen steel. The
man's words and deeds are still vigorous and alive; in another
generation many of them will be dead as Marley--"dead as a door-nail."
Let us then each to his task, and each try, as best he may, to weigh
in honest scales the modern Hannibal--"our last great man,"[4] "the
mightiest genius of two thousand years."[5]

  H. F. HALL.

Napoleon is by no means an easy writer to translate adequately. He
had always a terse, concise mode of speaking, and this, with the
constant habit of dictating, became accentuated. Whenever he could
use a short, compact word he did so. The greatest temptation has
been to render his very modern ideas by modern colloquialisms.
Occasionally, where Murray's Dictionary proves that the word was
in vogue a century ago, we have used a somewhat rarer word than
Napoleon's equivalent, as _e.g._ "coolth," in Letter No. 6, Series
B (_pendant le frais_), in order to preserve as far as possible the
brevity and crispness of the original. Napoleon's vocabulary was not
specially wide, but always exact. In expletive it was extensive
and peculiar. Judging his brother by himself, he did not consider
Lucien sufficient of a purist in French literature to write epics;
and the same remark would have been partly true of the Emperor,
who, however, was always at considerable pains to verify any word
of which he did not know the exact meaning.[6] His own appetite
for literature was enormous, especially during the year's garrison
life he spent at Valence, where he read and re-read the contents of a
_bouquiniste's_ shop, and, what is more, remembered them, so much so
that, nearly a quarter of a century later, he was able to correct the
dates of ecclesiastical experts at Erfurt. Whatever he says or
whatever he writes, one always finds a specific gravity of stark,
staring facts altogether abnormal. For generations it was the fashion
to consider "as false as a bulletin" peculiar to Napoleon's
despatches; but the publication of Napoleon's correspondence, by
order of Napoleon III., has changed all that. In the first place,
as to dates. Not only have Haydn, Woodward and Cates, and the
_Encyclopædia Britannica_ made mistakes during this period, but
even the _Biographie Universelle_ (usually so careful) is not
immaculate. Secondly, with regard to the descriptions of the battles.
We have never found one that in accuracy and truthfulness would
not compare to conspicuous advantage with some of those with which
we were only too familiar in December 1899. Napoleon was sometimes
1200 miles away from home; he had to gauge the effect of his
bulletins from one end to the other of the largest effective empire
that the world has ever seen, and, like Dr. Johnson in Fleet
Street reporting Parliamentary debates (but with a hundred times more
reason), he was determined not to let the other dogs have the best of
it. The notes on the battles of Eylau (Series H) and Essling (Series
L), the two most conspicuous examples of where it was necessary to
colour the bulletins, will show what is meant. Carlyle was the first
to point out that his despatches are as instinct with genius as his
conquests--his very words have "Austerlitz battles" in them. The
reference to "General Danube," in 1809, as the best general the
Austrians had, was one of those flashes of inspiration which
military writers, from Napoleon to Lord Wolseley, have shown to be
a determining factor in every doubtful fray.

"_Approfondissez_--go to the bottom of things," wrote Lord Chesterfield;
and this might have been the life-motto of the Emperor. But to adopt
this fundamental common-sense with regard to the character of Napoleon
is almost impossible; it is, to use the metaphor of Lord Rosebery,
like trying to span a mountain with a tape. We can but indicate a few
leading features. In the first place, he had, like the great
Stagirite, an eye at once telescopic and microscopic. Beyond the
_mécanique céleste_, beyond the nebulous reign of chaos and old night,
his ken pierced the primal truth--the need of a Creator: "not every
one can be an atheist who wishes it." No man saw deeper into the causes
of things. The influence of sea power on history, to take one
example, was never absent from his thoughts. Slowly and laboriously he
built and rebuilt his fleets, only to fall into the hands of his "Punic"
rival. Beaten at sea, he has but two weapons left against England--to
"conquer her by land," or to stir up a maritime rival who will sooner
or later avenge him. We have the Emperor Alexander's testimony from
the merchants of Manchester, Birmingham, and Liverpool how nearly his
Continental System _had_ ruined us. The rival raised up beyond the
western waves by the astute sale of Louisiana is still growing. In less
than a decade Napoleon had a first crumb of comfort (when such crumbs
were rare) in hearing of the victories of the _Constitution_ over
British frigates.

As for his microscopic eye, we know of nothing like it in all history.
In focussing the facets, we seem to shadow out the main secret of his
success--his ceaseless survey of all sorts and conditions of
knowledge. "Never despise local information," he wrote Murat, who was
at Naples, little anticipating the extremes of good and evil fortune
which awaited him there. Another characteristic--one in which he
surpassed alike the theory of Macchiavelli and the practice of the
Medici--was his use of _la bascule_, with himself as equilibrist or
average adjuster, as the only safe principle of government. Opinions
on the whole[7] lean to the idea that, up to the First Consulate,
Napoleon was an active Freemason, at a time when politics were
permitted, and when the Grand Orient, having initiated Voltaire almost
on his deathbed, and having been submerged by the Terror, was
beginning to show new life. In any case, we have in O'Meara the
Emperor's statement (and this is rather against the theory of Napoleon
being more than his brother Joseph, a mere patron of the craft) that
he encouraged the brotherhood. Cambacérès had more Masonic degrees
than probably any man before or since, and no man was so long and so
consistently trusted by Napoleon, with one short and significant
exception. Then there was the _gendarmerie d'élite_, then the ordinary
police, the myrmidons of Fouché of Nantes--in fact, if we take Lord
Rosebery literally, Napoleon had "half-a-dozen police agencies of his
own." There was also Talleyrand and, during the Concordats, the whole
priest-craft of Christendom as enlisting sergeants and spies
extraordinary for the Emperor. Finally, when he wishes to attack
Russia, he convokes a Sanhedrim at Paris, and wins the active
sympathies of Israel. "He was his own War Office, his own Foreign
Office, his own Admiralty."[8] His weak spot was his neglect of woman
as a political factor; this department he left to Josephine, who was a
failure. She gained popularity, but no converts. The Faubourg St.
Germain mistrusted a woman whose chief friend was the wife of
Thermidorian Tallien--Notre Dame de Septembre. In vain Napoleon raged
and stormed about the Tallien friendship, till his final mandate in
1806; and then it was too late.

Another characteristic, very marked in these Home Letters, is the
desire not to give his wife anxiety. His ailments and his difficulties
are always minimised.

Perhaps no man ever worked so hard physically and mentally as Napoleon
from 1796 to 1814. Lord Rosebery reminds us that "he would post from
Poland to Paris, summon a council at once, and preside over it with
his usual vigour and acuteness." And his councils were no joke; they
would last eight or ten hours. Once, at two o'clock in the morning,
the councillors were all worn-out; the Minister of Marine was fast
asleep. Napoleon still urged them to further deliberation: "Come,
gentlemen, pull yourselves together; it is only two o'clock, we must
earn the money that the nation gives us." The Commission who first
sifted the _Correspondence_ may well speak of the ceaseless workings
of that mind, which _knew no rest save change of occupation_, and of
"that universal intelligence from which nothing escaped." The chief
fault in Napoleon as a statesman was intrinsically a virtue, viz., his
good nature. There was, as Sir Walter Scott has said, "gentleness and
even softness in his character. It was his common and expressive
phrase that the heart of a politician should be in his head; but his
feelings sometimes surprised him in a gentler mood."

To be a relation of his own or his wife's, to have been a friend in
his time of stress, was to have a claim on Napoleon's support which no
subsequent treachery to himself could efface. From the days of his new
power--political power, first the Consulate and then the Empire--he
lavished gifts and favours even on the most undeserving of his early
comrades. Fouché, Talleyrand, Bernadotte were forgiven once, twice,
and again, to his own final ruin. Like Medea, one of whose other
exploits he had evoked in a bulletin, he could say--but to his honour
and not to his shame--

          "Si possem, sanior essem.
  Sed trahit invitam nova vis; aliudque Cupido,
  Mens aliud suadet. Video meliora, proboque
  Deteriora sequor."

Treachery and peculation against the State was different, as Moreau,
Bourrienne, and even Massena and Murat discovered.

As for his family, they were a flabby and somewhat sensual lot, with
the exception of Lucien, who was sufficiently capable to be hopelessly
impracticable. He was, however, infinitely more competent than the
effeminate Joseph and the melancholy Louis, and seems to have had more
command of parliamentary oratory than Napoleon himself.

Napoleon's influence on literary men may be gauged by what Wieland[9]
and Müller[10] reported of their interview with him at Erfurt. That
with Wieland took place at the ball which followed the entertainment
on the field of Jena. "I was presented," he says, "by the Duchess of
Weimar, with the usual ceremonies; he then paid me some compliments in
an affable tone, and looked steadfastly at me. Few men have
appeared to me to possess, in the same degree, the art of reading
at the first glance the thoughts of other men. He saw, in an
instant, that notwithstanding my celebrity I was simple in my manners
and void of pretension; and, as he seemed desirous of making a
favourable impression on me, he assumed the tone most likely to
attain his end. I have never beheld any one more calm, more simple,
more mild, or less ostentatious in appearance; nothing about him
indicated the feeling of power in a great monarch; he spoke to me as
an old acquaintance would speak to an equal; and what was more
extraordinary on his part, he conversed with me exclusively for an
hour and a half, to the great surprise of the whole assembly."
Wieland has related part of their conversation, which is, as it could
not fail to be, highly interesting. They touched on a variety of
subjects; among others, the ancients. Napoleon declared his
preference of the Romans to the Greeks. "The eternal squabbles of
their petty republics," he said, "were not calculated to give birth
to anything grand; whereas the Romans were always occupied with great
things, and it was owing to this they raised up the Colossus which
bestrode the world." This preference was characteristic; the
following is anomalous: "He preferred Ossian to Homer." "He was fond
only of serious poetry," continues Wieland; "the pathetic and
vigorous writers; and, above all, the tragic poets. He appeared to
have no relish for anything gay; and in spite of the prepossessing
amenity of his manners, an observation struck me often, he seemed to
be of bronze. Nevertheless, he had put me so much at my ease that I
ventured to ask how it was that the public worship he had restored
in France was not more philosophical and in harmony with the
spirit of the times? 'My dear Wieland,' he replied, 'religion is not
meant for philosophers; they have no faith either in me or my
priests. As to those who do believe, it would be difficult to give
them or to leave them too much of the marvellous. If I had to
frame a religion for philosophers, it would be just the reverse of
that of the credulous part of mankind.'"[11]

Müller, the celebrated Swiss historian, who had a private interview
with Napoleon at this period, has left a still fuller account of the
impression he received. "The Emperor[12] began to speak," says Müller,
"of the history of Switzerland, told me that I ought to complete it,
that even the more recent times had their interest. He proceeded from
the Swiss to the old Greek constitutions and history; to the theory of
constitutions; to the complete diversity of those of Asia, and the
causes of this diversity in the climate, polygamy, &c.; the opposite
characters of the Arabian and the Tartar races; the peculiar value of
European culture, and the progress of freedom since the sixteenth
century; how everything was linked together, and in the inscrutable
guidance of an invisible hand; how he himself had become great through
his enemies; the great confederation of nations, the idea of which
Henry IV. had; the foundation of all religion, and its necessity; that
man could not bear clear truth, and required to be kept in order;
admitting the possibility, however, of a more happy condition if the
numerous feuds ceased, which were occasioned by too complicated
constitutions (such as the German), and the intolerable burden
suffered by states from excessive armies." These opinions clearly mark
the guiding motives of Napoleon's attempts to enforce upon different
nations uniformity of institutions and customs. "I opposed him
occasionally," says Müller, "and he entered into discussion. Quite
impartially and truly, as before God, I must say that the variety of
his knowledge, the acuteness of his observations, the solidity of his
understanding (not dazzling wit), his grand and comprehensive views,
filled me with astonishment, and his manner of speaking to me, with
love for him. By his genius and his disinterested goodness, he has
also conquered me." Slowly but surely they are conquering the world.
Of his goodness we have the well-weighed verdict of Lord Acton, that
it was "the most splendid that has appeared on earth." Of his
goodness, we may at least concur in the opinion of the old British tar
at Elba, quoted by Sir Walter, and evidently his own view, that "Boney
was a d--d good fellow after all."

With regard to the character of _Josephine_ opinions still differ
about every quality but one. Like the friend of Goldsmith's mad dog--

  "A kind and gentle heart she had
    To comfort friends and foes:"

either her brother Mason Cambacérès, or her brother Catholic and
unbrotherly brother-in-law Lucien.

From early days she had learnt "how to flirt and how to fib." Morality
was at a low ebb during the French Revolution, when women often saved
their necks at the expense of their bodies, and there is unfortunately
no doubt that Josephine was no exception. It is certain, however, from
his first letters to Josephine, that Napoleon knew nothing of this at
the time of his honeymoon (solus) in Italy. Gradually, but very
unwillingly, his eyes were opened, and by the time he had reached
Egypt he felt himself absolved from the absolute faithfulness he had
hitherto preserved towards his wife. On his return Josephine becomes
once more his consort, and even his friend--never again his only love.
Josephine's main characteristic henceforward is to make everybody
happy and comfortable--in spite of Napoleon's grumblings at her
reckless prodigality; never to say No! (except to her husband's
accusations) suits her Creole disposition best, especially as it costs
her no active exertion, and the Emperor pays for all. And so, having
been in turn Our Lady of Victories and Saint Mary the Egyptian, she
becomes from her coronation to her death-day "The Mother of the
Poor."

THE SOURCES OF THE LETTERS.--These may be divided into three
parts--(1st) the Early Love-Letters of 1796; (2nd) the Collection
published by Didot Frères in 1833; and (3rd) the few scattered Letters
gathered from various outside sources.

(1st) With regard to the Early Love-Letters of 1796, these are found
most complete in a work published by Longmans in 1824, in two volumes,
with the title, "A Tour through Parts of the Netherlands, Holland,
Germany, Switzerland, Savoy, and France, in the year 1821-2, by
Charles Tennant, Esq.; also containing in an Appendix Fac-simile
Copies of Eight Letters in the handwriting of Napoleon Bonaparte to
his wife Josephine."

The author introduces them with an interesting preface, which shows
that then, as now, the interest in everything connected with Napoleon
was unabated:--

"Long after this fleeting book shall have passed away, and with its
author shall have been forgotten, these documents will remain; for
here, perhaps, is to be found the purest source of information which
exists, touching the private character of Napoleon Bonaparte, known,
probably, but to the few whose situations have enabled them to observe
that extraordinary man in the undisguised relations of domestic life.
Although much already has been said and written of him, yet the
eagerness with which every little anecdote and incident of his life is
sought for shows the interest which still attaches to his name, and
these, no doubt, will be bequests which posterity will duly estimate.
From these it will be the province of future historians to cull and
select simple and authenticated facts, and from these only can be
drawn a true picture of the man whose fame has already extended into
every distant region of the habitable globe.

       *       *       *       *       *

"I will now proceed to relate the means by which I am enabled to
introduce into this journal fac-simile copies of eight letters in the
handwriting of Napoleon Bonaparte, the originals of which are in my
possession. Had these been of a political nature, much as I should
prize any relics of such a man, yet they would not have appeared in a
book from which I have studiously excluded all controversial topics,
and more especially those of a political character. Neither should I
have ventured upon their publication if there were a possibility that
by so doing I might wound the feelings of any human being. Death has
closed the cares of the individuals connected with these letters. Like
the memorials of Alexander the Great or of Charlemagne, they are the
property of the possessor, and through him of the public; but not like
ancient documents, dependent upon legendary evidence for their
identity and truth.

"These have passed to me through two hands only, since they came into
possession of the Empress Josephine, to whom they are written by
their illustrious author. One of the individuals here alluded to, and
from whom I received these letters, is a Polish nobleman, who attached
himself and his fortunes to Bonaparte, whose confidence he enjoyed in
several important diplomatic negotiations."

This book and these letters were known to Sir Walter Scott, who made
use of some of them in his _History of Napoleon_. M. Aubenas, in his
_Histoire de l'Impératrice Joséphine_, published in 1857, which has
been lavishly made use of in a recent work on the same subject, seems
to have known, at any rate, four of these letters, which were
communicated to him by M. le Baron Feuillet de Conches. Monsieur
Aubenas seems never to have seen the Tennant Collection, of which
these undoubtedly form part, but as Baron Feuillet de Conches was an
expert in deciphering Bonaparte's extraordinary caligraphy, these
letters are very useful for reference in helping us to translate some
phrases which had been given up as illegible by Mr. Tennant and Sir
Walter Scott.

(2nd) The _Collection Didot_. This enormously valuable collection
forms by far the greater part of the Letters that we possess of
Napoleon to his wife. They are undoubtedly authentic, and have
been utilised largely by Aubenas, St. Amand, Masson, and the
_Correspondance de Napoléon I._ They were edited by Madame Salvage
de Faverolles. As is well known, Sir Walter Scott was very anxious to
obtain possession of these letters for his _Life of Napoleon_, and
his visit to Paris was partly on this account. In _Archibald
Constable and his Literary Correspondents_, edited in 1873 by his son,
we find the following:--


"_Letter from_ ARCHIBALD CONSTABLE _to_ SIR WALTER SCOTT.

  "_August 30, 1825._

"I have had various conversations with Mr. Thomson on the subject of
Napoleon's correspondence with Josephine. Mr. Thomson communicated
with Count Flahault for me in the view of its being published, and
whether the letters could not, in the meantime, be rendered
accessible. The publication, it seems, under any circumstances, is by
no means determined on, but should they be given, the price expected
is five thousand guineas, which I should imagine greatly too much. I
have an enumeration of the letters, from whence written, &c. I shall
subjoin a copy of it."

When they were finally published in 1833, they seem to have been
stimulated into existence by publication of the _Mémorial de
Saint-Helène_, better known in England as _Las Cases_. Doubtless
Hortense only allowed such letters to be published as would not injure
the reputation of her mother or her relations. In the Preface it is
stated: "We think that these letters will afford an interest as
important as delightful. Everything that comes from Napoleon, and
everything that appertains to him, will always excite the lively
attention of contemporaries and posterity. If the lofty meditation of
philosophy concerns itself only with the general influence of great
men upon their own generation and future ones, a curiosity of another
nature, and not less greedy, loves to penetrate into the inmost
recesses of their soul, in order to elicit their most secret
inclinations. It likes to learn what has been left of the _man_, amid
the preoccupations of their projects and the elevation of their
fortune. It requires to know in what manner their character has
modified their genius, or has been subservient to it.

"It is this curiosity that we hope to satisfy by the publication of
these letters. They reveal the inmost thought of Napoleon, they will
reflect his earliest impulses, they will show how the General, the
Consul, and the Emperor felt and spoke, not in his discourses or his
proclamations--the official garb of his thought--but in the free
outpourings of the most passionate or the most tender affections....
This correspondence will prove, we strongly believe, that the
conqueror was human, the master of the world a good husband, the great
man in fact an excellent man.... We shall see in them how, up to the
last moment, he lavished on his wife proofs of his tenderness. Without
doubt the letters of the Emperor Napoleon are rarer and shorter than
those of the First Consul, and the First Consul writes no longer like
General Bonaparte, but everywhere the sentiment is fundamentally the
same.

"We make no reflection on the style of these letters, written in haste
and in all the _abandon_ of intimacy. We can easily perceive they were
not destined to see the light. Nevertheless we publish them without
changing anything in them."

The _Collection Didot_ contains 228 letters from Napoleon to
Josephine, and 70 from Josephine to Hortense, and two from Josephine
to Napoleon, which seem to be the only two in existence of Josephine
to Napoleon whose authenticity is unquestioned.

(3rd) The fugitive letters are collected from various sources, and
their genuineness does not seem to be quite as well proved as those
of the Tennant or Didot Series. We have generally taken the
_Correspondence of Napoleon I._ as the touchstone of their merit to be
inserted here, although one of them--that republished from _Las
Cases_ (No. 85, Series G.)--is manifestly mainly the work of that
versatile author, who is utterly unreliable except when confirmed
by others. As Lord Rosebery has well said, the book is "an arsenal
of spurious documents."

We have relegated to an Appendix those published by Madame Ducrest, as
transparent forgeries, and have to acknowledge with thanks a letter
from M. Masson on this subject which thoroughly confirms these views.
There seems some reason to doubt No. I., Series E, but being in the
_Correspondence_, I have translated it.

The _Correspondence of Napoleon I._ is a splendid monument to the
memory of Napoleon. It is alluded to throughout the Notes as _The
Correspondence_, and it deserves special recognition here. Its
compilation was decreed by Napoleon III. from Boulogne, on 7th
September 1854, and the first volume appeared in 1858, and the last in
1870. With the first volume is inserted the Report of the Commission
to the Emperor, part of which we subjoin:--


"_Report of the Commission to the Emperor._

"SIRE,--Augustus numbered Cæsar among the gods, and dedicated to him a
temple; the temple has disappeared, the Commentaries remain. Your
Majesty, wishing to raise to the chief of your dynasty an imperishable
monument, has ordered us to gather together and publish the political,
military, and administrative correspondence of Napoleon I. It has
realised that the most conspicuous (_éclatant_) homage to render to
this incomparable genius was to make him known in his entirety. No one
is ignorant of his victories, of the laws with which he has endowed
our country, the institutions that he has founded and which dwell
immovable after so many revolutions; his prosperity and his reverses
are in every mouth; history has recounted what he has done, but it has
not always known his designs: it has not had the secret of so many
admirable combinations that have been the spoil of fortune (_que la
fortune a dejouées_), and so many grand projects for the execution of
which time alone was wanting. The traces of Napoleon's thoughts were
scattered; it was necessary to reunite them and to give them to the
light.

"Such is the task which your Majesty confided to us, and of which we
were far from suspecting the extent. The thousands of letters which
were received from all parts have allowed us to follow, in spite of a
few regrettable _lacunæ_, the thoughts of Napoleon day by day, and to
assist, so to say, at the birth of his projects, at the ceaseless
workings of his mind, which knew no other rest than change of
occupation. But what is perhaps most surprising in the reading of a
correspondence so varied, is the power of that universal intelligence
from which nothing escaped, which in turn raised itself without an
effort to the most sublime conceptions, and which descends with the
same facility to the smallest details.... Nothing seems to him
unworthy of his attention that has to do with the realisation of his
designs; and it is not sufficient for him to give the most precise
orders, but he superintends himself the execution of them with an
indefatigable perseverance.

"The letters of Napoleon can add nothing to his glory, but they better
enable us to comprehend his prodigious destiny, the prestige that he
exercised over his contemporaries--'le culte universel dont sa mémoire
est l'objet, enfin, l'entraînement irrésistible par lequel la France a
replacé sa dynastie au sommet de l'édifice qu'il avait construit.'

"These letters also contain the most fruitful sources of information
... for peoples as for governments; for soldiers and for statesmen no
less than for historians. Perhaps some persons, greedy of knowing the
least details concerning the intimate life of great men, will regret
that we have not reproduced those letters which, published elsewhere
for the most part, have only dealt with family affairs and domestic
relations. Collected together by us as well as the others, they have
not found a place in the plan of which your Majesty has fixed for us
the limits.

"Let us haste to declare that, in conformity with the express
intentions of your Majesty, we have scrupulously avoided, in the
reproduction of the letters of the Emperor, any alteration,
curtailment, or modification of the text. Sometimes, thinking of the
legitimate sorrow which blame from so high a quarter may cause, we
have regretted not to be able to soften the vigorous judgment of
Napoleon on many of his contemporaries, but it was not our province to
discuss them, still less to explain them; but if, better informed or
calmer, the Emperor has rendered justice to those of his servants that
he had for a moment misunderstood, we have been glad to indicate that
these severe words have been followed by reparation.

"We have found it necessary to have the spelling of names of places
and of persons frequently altered, but we have allowed to remain
slight incorrectnesses of language which denote the impetuosity of
composition, and which often could not be rectified without weakening
the originality of an energetic style running right to its object,
brief and precise as the words of command. Some concise notes
necessary for clearing up obscure passages are the sole conditions
which we have allowed ourselves....

"The Commission has decided in favour of chronological order
throughout. It is, moreover, the only one which can reproduce
faithfully the sequence of the Emperor's thoughts. It is also the best
for putting in relief his universal aptitude and his marvellous
fecundity.

"Napoleon wrote little with his own hand; nearly all the items of his
correspondence were dictated to his secretaries, to his aides-de-camp
and his chief of staff, or to his ministers. Thus the Commission has
not hesitated to comprise in this collection a great number of items
which, although bearing another signature, evidently emanate from
Napoleon....

"By declaring that his public life dated from the siege of Toulon,
Napoleon has himself determined the point of departure which the
Commission should choose. It is from this immortal date that commences
the present publication.

  "(Signed) THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION.

  "_Paris, January 20, 1858._"

CONTEMPORARY SOURCES.--It is a commonplace that the history of
Napoleon has yet to be written. His contemporaries were stunned or
overwhelmed by the whirlwind of his glory; the next generation was
blinded by meteoric fragments of his "system," which glowed with
impotent heat as they fell through an alien atmosphere into oblivion.
Such were the Bourriennes, the Jominis, the Talleyrands, and other
traitors of that ilk. But

  "The tumult and the shouting dies;
  The captains and the kings depart;"

and now, when all the lesser tumults and lesser men _have_ passed
away, each new century will, as Lockhart foretold, "inscribe one
mighty era with the majestic name of Napoleon." And yet the writings
of no contemporary can be ignored; neither Alison nor Scott, certainly
not Bignon, Montgaillard, Pelet, Mathieu Dumas, and Pasquier.
Constant, Bausset, Méneval, Rovigo, and D'Abrantès are full of
interest for their personal details, and D'Avrillon, Las Cases,
Marmont, Marbot, and Lejeune only a degree less so. Jung's _Memoirs of
Lucien_ are invaluable, and those of Joseph and Louis Bonaparte
useful. But the _Correspondence_ is worth everything else, including
Panckouke (1796-99), where, in spite of shocking arrangement, print,
and paper, we get the replies as well as the letters. The _Biographie
Universelle Michaud_ is hostile, except the interesting footnotes of
Bégin. It must, however, be read. The article in the _Encyclopædia
Britannica_ was the work of an avowed enemy of the Napoleonic system,
the editor of the _Life and Times of Stein_.

For the Diary, the _Revue Chronologique de l'Histoire de France_ or
Montgaillard (1823) has been heavily drawn upon, especially for the
later years, but wherever practicable the dates have been verified
from the _Correspondence_ and bulletins of the day. On the whole, the
records of respective losses in the battles are slightly favourable to
the French, as their figures have been usually taken; always, however,
the maximum French loss and the minimum of the allies is recorded,
when unverified from other sources.

The late Professor Seeley, in his monograph, asserts that Napoleon,
tried by his plan, is a failure--that even before death his words and
actions merited no monument. We must seek, however, for the mightiest
heritage of Napoleon in his brainchildren of the second generation,
the Genii of the Code.

The Code Napoleon claims to-day its two hundred million subjects. "The
Law should be clean, precise, uniform; to interpret is to corrupt it."
So ruled the Emperor; and now, a century later, Archbishop Temple
(born in one distant island the year Napoleon died in another) bears
testimony to the beneficent sway of Napoleon's Word-Empire.
Criticising English legal phraseology, the Archbishop of Canterbury
said, "The French Code is always welcome in every country where it has
been introduced; and where people have once got hold of it, they are
unwilling to have it changed for any other, because it is _a marvel of
clearness_." Surely if ever Style _is_ the Man, it is Napoleon,
otherwise the inspection of over seven million words, as marshalled
forth in his _Correspondence_, would not only confuse but confound. As
it is, its "hum of armies, gathering rank on rank," has left behind
what Bacon calls a conflation of sound, from which, however, as from
Kipling's steel-sinewed symphony,

                  "The clanging chorus goes--
  Law, Order, Duty and Restraint, Obedience, Discipline."

       lexicographer, as for example when, the day after Wagram, he
       writes his Minister of War that the _coup de Jarnac_ will come
       from the English in Spain. Now, when the Jarnac in question was
       slain in fair fight by La Chateignerie by a blow _au jarret_,
       it was an _unexpected_ blow, but not surely, as Littré tells
       us, _manoeuvre perfide_, _déloyale_. Nothing was too disloyal
       for perfidious Albion, but for 30,000 English to outmanoeuvre
       three marshals and 100,000 French veterans would be, and was,
       the unexpected which happened at Talavera three weeks later.

NAPOLEON'S LETTERS

SERIES A

(1796)


"Only those who knew Napoleon in the intercourse of private life can
render justice to his character. For my own part, I know him, as it
were, by heart; and in proportion as time separates us, he appears to
me like a beautiful dream. And would you believe that, in my
recollections of Napoleon, that which seems to me to approach most
nearly to ideal excellence is not the hero, filling the world with his
gigantic fame, but the man, viewed in the relations of private
life?"--_Recollections of Caulaincourt_, _Duke of Vicenza_, vol. i.

  _Seven o'clock in the morning._

My waking thoughts are all of thee. Your portrait and the remembrance
of last night's delirium have robbed my senses of repose. Sweet and
incomparable Josephine, what an extraordinary influence you have over
my heart. Are you vexed? do I see you sad? are you ill at ease? My
soul is broken with grief, and there is no rest for your lover. But is
there more for me when, delivering ourselves up to the deep feelings
which master me, I breathe out upon your lips, upon your heart, a
flame which burns me up--ah, it was this past night I realised that
your portrait was not you. You start at noon; I shall see you in three
hours. Meanwhile, _mio dolce amor_, accept a thousand kisses,[14] but
give me none, for they fire my blood.

  _Chanceaux Post House,
  March 14, 1796._

I wrote you at Chatillon, and sent you a power of attorney to enable
you to receive various sums of money in course of remittance to me.
Every moment separates me further from you, my beloved, and every
moment I have less energy to exist so far from you. You are the
constant object of my thoughts; I exhaust my imagination in thinking
of what you are doing. If I see you unhappy, my heart is torn, and my
grief grows greater. If you are gay and lively among your friends
(male and female), I reproach you with having so soon forgotten the
sorrowful separation three days ago; thence you must be fickle, and
henceforward stirred by no deep emotions. So you see I am not easy to
satisfy; but, my dear, I have quite different sensations when I fear
that your health may be affected, or that you have cause to be
annoyed; then I regret the haste with which I was separated from my
darling. I feel, in fact, that your natural kindness of heart exists
no longer for me, and it is only when I am quite sure you are not
vexed that I am satisfied. If I were asked how I slept, I feel that
before replying I should have to get a message to tell me that you had
had a good night. The ailments, the passions of men influence me only
when I imagine they may reach you, my dear. May my good genius, which
has always preserved me in the midst of great dangers, surround you,
enfold you, while I will face my fate unguarded. Ah! be not gay, but a
trifle melancholy; and especially may your soul be free from worries,
as your body from illness: you know what our good Ossian says on this
subject. Write me, dear, and at full length, and accept the thousand
and one kisses of your most devoted and faithful friend.

No. 3.

  _April 3rd.--He is at Mentone._

  _Port Maurice, April 3rd._

I have received all your letters, but none has affected me like the
last. How can you think, my charmer, of writing me in such terms? Do
you believe that my position is not already painful enough without
further increasing my regrets and subverting my reason. What
eloquence, what feelings you portray; they are of fire, they inflame
my poor heart! My unique Josephine, away from you there is no more
joy--away from thee the world is a wilderness, in which I stand alone,
and without experiencing the bliss of unburdening my soul. You have
robbed me of more than my soul; you are the one only thought of my
life. When I am weary of the worries of my profession, when I mistrust
the issue, when men disgust me, when I am ready to curse my life, I
put my hand on my heart where your portrait beats in unison. I look at
it, and love is for me complete happiness; and everything laughs for
joy, except the time during which I find myself absent from my
beloved.

By what art have you learnt how to captivate all my faculties, to
concentrate in yourself my spiritual existence--it is witchery, dear
love, which will end only with me. To live for Josephine, that is the
history of my life. I am struggling to get near you, I am dying to be
by your side; fool that I am, I fail to realise how far off I am, that
lands and provinces separate us. What an age it will be before you
read these lines, the weak expressions of the fevered soul in which
you reign. Ah, my winsome wife, I know not what fate awaits me, but if
it keeps me much longer from you it will be unbearable--my strength
will not last out. There was a time in which I prided myself on my
strength, and, sometimes, when casting my eyes on the ills which men
might do me, on the fate that destiny might have in store for me, I
have gazed steadfastly on the most incredible misfortunes without a
wrinkle on my brow or a vestige of surprise: but to-day the thought
that my Josephine might be ill; and, above all, the cruel, the fatal
thought that she might love me less, blights my soul, stops my blood,
makes me wretched and dejected, without even leaving me the courage of
fury and despair. I often used to say that men have no power over him
who dies without regrets; but, to-day, to die without your love, to
die in uncertainty of that, is the torment of hell, it is a lifelike
and terrifying figure of absolute annihilation--I feel passion
strangling me. My unique companion! you whom Fate has destined to walk
with me the painful path of life! the day on which I no longer possess
your heart will be that on which parched Nature will be for me without
warmth and without vegetation. I stop, dear love! my soul is sad, my
body tired, my spirit dazed, men worry me--I ought indeed to detest
them; they keep me from my beloved.

I am at Port Maurice, near Oneille; to-morrow I shall be at Albenga.
The two armies are in motion. We are trying to deceive each
other--victory to the most skilful! I am pretty well satisfied with
Beaulieu; he need be a much stronger man than his predecessor to alarm
me much. I expect to give him a good drubbing. Don't be anxious; love
me as thine eyes, but that is not enough; as thyself, more than
thyself; as thy thoughts, thy mind, thy sight, thy all. Dear love,
forgive me, I am exhausted; nature is weak for him who feels acutely,
for him whom you inspire.

thee.

  _Albenga, April 5th._

It is an hour after midnight. They have just brought me a letter. It
is a sad one, my mind is distressed--it is the death of Chauvet. He
was _commissionaire ordinateur en chef_ of the army; you have
sometimes seen him at the house of Barras. My love, I feel the need of
consolation. It is by writing to thee, to thee alone, the thought of
whom can so influence my moral being, to whom I must pour out my
troubles. What means the future? what means the past? what are we
ourselves? what magic fluid surrounds and hides from us the things
that it behoves us most to know? We are born, we live, we die in the
midst of marvels; is it astounding that priests, astrologers,
charlatans have profited by this propensity, by this strange
circumstance, to exploit our ideas, and direct them to their own
advantage. Chauvet is dead. He was attached to me. He has rendered
essential service to the fatherland. His last words were that he was
starting to join me. Yes, I see his ghost; it hovers everywhere, it
whistles in the air. His soul is in the clouds, he will be propitious
to my destiny. But, fool that I am, I shed tears for our friendship,
and who shall tell me that I have not already to bewail the
irreparable. Soul of my life, write me by every courier, else I shall
not know how to exist. I am very busy here. Beaulieu is moving his
army again. We are face to face. I am rather tired; I am every day on
horseback. Adieu, adieu, adieu; I am going to dream of you. Sleep
consoles me; it places you by my side, I clasp you in my arms. But on
waking, alas! I find myself three hundred leagues from you.
Remembrances to Barras, Tallien, and his wife.

  _Albenga, April 7th._

I have received the letter that you break off, in order, you say, to
go into the country; and in spite of that you give me to understand
that you are jealous of me, who am here, overwhelmed with business and
fatigue. Ah, my dear, it is true I am wrong. In the spring the country
is beautiful, and then the lover of nineteen will doubtless find means
to spare an extra moment to write to him who, distant three hundred
leagues from thee, lives, enjoys, exists only in thoughts of thee, who
reads thy letters as one devours, after six hours' hunting, the meat
he likes best. I am not satisfied with your last letter; it is cold as
friendship. I have not found that fire which kindles your looks, and
which I have sometimes fancied I found there. But how infatuated I am.
I found your previous letters weigh too heavily on my mind. The
revolution which they produced there invaded my rest, and took my
faculties captive. I desired more frigid letters, but they gave me the
chill of death. Not to be loved by Josephine, the thought of finding
her inconstant ... but I am forging troubles--there are so many real
ones, there is no need to manufacture more! You cannot have inspired a
boundless love without sharing it, for a cultured mind and a soul like
yours cannot requite complete surrender and devotion with the
death-blow.

I have received the letter from Madame Chateau Renard. I have written
to the Minister. I will write to the former to-morrow, to whom you
will make the usual compliments. Kind regards to Madame Tallien and
Barras.

You do not speak of your wretched indigestion--I hate it. Adieu, till
to-morrow, _mio dolce amor_. A remembrance from my unique wife, and a
victory from Destiny--these are my wishes: a unique remembrance
entirely worthy of him who thinks of thee every moment.

My brother is here; he has learnt of my marriage with pleasure. He
longs to see you. I am trying to prevail on him to go to Paris--his
wife has just borne him a girl. He sends you a gift of a box of Genoa
bonbons. You will receive oranges, perfumes, and orange-flower water,
which I am sending.

Junot and Murat present their respects to you.

_To My Sweet Love._--My brother will remit you this letter. I have for
him the most lively affection. I trust he will obtain yours; he merits
it. Nature has endowed him with a gentle, even, and unalterably good
disposition; he is made up of good qualities. I am writing Barras to
help him to the Consulate of some Italian port. He wishes to live with
his little wife far from the great whirlwind, and from great events. I
recommend him to you. I have received your letters of (April) the
fifth and tenth. You have been several days without writing me. What
_are_ you doing then? Yes, my kind, kind love, I am not jealous, but
sometimes uneasy. Come soon. I warn you, if you tarry you will find me
ill; fatigue and your absence are too much for me at the same time.

Your letters make up my daily pleasure, and my happy days are not
often. Junot bears to Paris twenty-two flags. You ought to return with
him, do you understand? Be ready, if that is not disagreeable to you.
Should he not come, woe without remedy; should he come back to me
alone, grief without consolation, constant anxiety. My Beloved, he
will see you, he will breathe on your temples; perhaps you will accord
him the unique and priceless favour of kissing your cheek, and I, I
shall be alone and very far away; but you are about to come, are you
not? You will soon be beside me, on my breast, in my arms, over your
mouth. Take wings, come quickly, but travel gently. The route is long,
bad, fatiguing. If you should be overturned or be taken ill, if
fatigue--go gently, my beloved.

I have received a letter from Hortense. She is entirely lovable. I am
going to write to her. I love her much, and I will soon send her the
perfumes that she wants.

TO JOSEPHINE.

  _Tortona, Noon, June 15th._

My life is a perpetual nightmare. A presentiment of ill oppresses me.
I see you no longer. I have lost more than life, more than happiness,
more than my rest. I am almost without hope. I hasten to send a
courier to you. He will stay only four hours in Paris, and then
bring me your reply. Write me ten pages. That alone can console me a
little. You are ill, you love me, I have made you unhappy, you are in
delicate health, and I do not see you!--that thought overwhelms me. I
have done you so much wrong that I know not how to atone for it; I
accuse you of staying in Paris, and you were ill there. Forgive me,
my dear; the love with which you have inspired me has bereft me of
reason. I shall never find it again. It is an ill for which there
is no cure. My presentiments are so ominous that I would confine
myself to merely seeing you, to pressing you for two hours to my
heart--and then dying with you. Who looks after you? I expect you
have sent for Hortense. I love that sweet child a thousand times more
when I think she can console you a little, though for me there is
neither consolation nor repose, nor hope until the courier that I
have sent comes back; and until, in a long letter, you explain to me
what is the nature of your illness, and to what extent it is
serious; if it be dangerous, I warn you, I start at once for
Paris. My coming shall coincide with your illness. I have always
been fortunate, never has my destiny resisted my will, and to-day I
am hurt in what touches me solely (_uniquement_). Josephine, how
can you remain so long without writing to me; your last laconic
letter is dated May 22. Moreover, it is a distressing one for me, but
I always keep it in my pocket; your portrait and letters are
perpetually before my eyes.

I am nothing without you. I scarcely imagine how I existed without
knowing you. Ah! Josephine, had you known my heart would you have
waited from May 18th to June 4th before starting? Would you have given
an ear to perfidious friends who are perhaps desirous of keeping you
away from me? I openly avow it to every one, I hate everybody who is
near you. I expected you to set out on May 24th, and arrive on June
3rd.

Josephine, if you love me, if you realise how everything depends on
your health, take care of yourself. I dare not tell you not to
undertake so long a journey, and that, too, in the hot weather. At
least, if you are fit to make it, come by short stages; write me at
every sleeping-place, and despatch your letters in advance.

All my thoughts are concentrated in thy boudoir, in thy bed, on thy
heart. Thy illness!--that is what occupies me night and day. Without
appetite, without sleep, without care for my friends, for glory, for
fatherland, you, you alone--the rest of the world exists no more for
me than if it were annihilated. I prize honour since you prize it, I
prize victory since it pleases you; without that I should leave
everything in order to fling myself at your feet.

Sometimes I tell myself that I alarm myself unnecessarily; that even
now she is better, that she is starting, has started, is perhaps
already at Lyons. Vain fancies! you are in bed suffering, more
beautiful, more interesting, more lovable. You are pale and your eyes
are more languishing, but when will you be cured? If one of us ought
to be ill it is I--more robust, more courageous; I should support
illness more easily. Destiny is cruel, it strikes at me through you.

What consoles me sometimes is to think that it is in the power of
destiny to make you ill; but it is in the power of no one to make me
survive you.

In your letter, dear, be sure to tell me that you are convinced that I
love you more than it is possible to imagine; that you are persuaded
that all my moments are consecrated to you; that to think of any other
woman has never entered my head--they are all in my eyes without
grace, wit, or beauty; that you, you alone, such as I see you, such as
you are, can please me, and absorb all the faculties of my mind; that
you have traversed its whole extent; that my heart has no recess into
which you have not seen, no thoughts which are not subordinate to
yours; that my strength, my prowess, my spirit are all yours; that my
soul is in your body; and that the day on which you change or cease to
live will be my death-day; that Nature, that Earth, is beautiful only
because you dwell therein. If you do not believe all this, if your
soul is not convinced, penetrated by it, you grieve me, you do not
love me--there is a magnetic fluid between people who love one
another--you know perfectly well that I could not brook a rival, much
less offer you one.[15] To tear out his heart and to see him would be
for me one and the same thing, and then if I were to carry my hands
against your sacred person--no, I should never dare to do it; but I
would quit a life in which the most virtuous of women had deceived
me.

But I am sure and proud of your love; misfortunes are the trials which
reveal to each mutually the whole force of our passion. A child as
charming as its mamma will soon see the daylight, and will pass many
years in your arms. Hapless me! I would be happy with one _day_. A
thousand kisses on your eyes, your lips, your tongue, your heart. Most
charming of thy sex, what is thy power over me? I am very sick of thy
sickness; I have still a burning fever! Do not keep the courier more
than six hours, and let him return at once to bring me the longed-for
letter of my Beloved.

Do you remember my dream, in which I was your boots, your dress, and
in which I made you come bodily into my heart? Why has not Nature
arranged matters in this way; she has much to do yet.

TO JOSEPHINE.

  _Pistoia, Tuscany, June 26th._

For a month I have only received from my dear love two letters of
three lines each. Is she so busy, that writing to her dear love is not
then needful for her, nor, consequently, thinking about him? To live
without thinking of Josephine would be death and annihilation to your
husband. Your image gilds my fancies, and enlivens the black and
sombre picture of melancholy and grief. A day perhaps may come in
which I shall see you, for I doubt not you will be still at Paris, and
verily on that day I will show you my pockets stuffed with letters
that I have not sent you because they are too foolish (_bête_). Yes,
that's the word. Good heavens! tell me, you who know so well how to
make others love you without being in love yourself, do you know how
to cure me of love??? I will give a good price for that remedy.

You ought to have started on May 24th. Being good-natured, I waited
till June 1st, as if a pretty woman would give up her habits, her
friends, both Madame Tallien and a dinner with Barras, and the acting
of a new play, and Fortuné; yes, Fortuné, whom you love much more than
your husband, for whom you have only a little of the esteem, and a
share of that benevolence with which your heart abounds. Every day I
count up your misdeeds. I lash myself to fury in order to love you no
more. Bah, don't I love you the more? In fact, my peerless little
mother, I will tell you my secret. Set me at defiance, stay at Paris,
have lovers--let everybody know it--never write me a monosyllable!
then I shall love you ten times more for it; and it is not folly, a
delirious fever! and I shall not get the better of it. Oh! would to
heaven I could get better! but don't tell me you are ill, don't try to
justify yourself. Good heavens! you are pardoned. I love you to
distraction, and never will my poor heart cease to give all for love.
If you did not love me, my fate would be indeed grotesque. You have
not written me; you are ill, you do not come. But you have passed
Lyons; you will be at Turin on the 28th, at Milan on the 30th, where
you will wait for me. You will be in Italy, and I shall be still far
from you. Adieu, my well-beloved; a kiss on thy mouth, another on thy
heart.

We have made peace with Rome--who gives us money. To-morrow we shall
be at Leghorn, and as soon as I can in your arms, at your feet, on
your bosom.

I got your letter, my beloved; it has filled my heart with joy. I am
grateful to you for the trouble you have taken to send me news; your
health should be better to-day--I am sure you are cured. I urge you
strongly to ride, which cannot fail to do you good.

Ever since I left you, I have been sad. I am only happy when by your
side. Ceaselessly I recall your kisses, your tears, your enchanting
jealousy; and the charms of the incomparable Josephine keep constantly
alight a bright and burning flame in my heart and senses. When, free
from every worry, from all business, shall I spend all my moments by
your side, to have nothing to do but to love you, and to prove it to
you? I shall send your horse, but I am hoping that you will soon be
able to rejoin me. I thought I loved you some days ago; but, since I
saw you, I feel that I love you even a thousand times more. Ever since
I have known you, I worship you more every day; which proves how false
is the maxim of La Bruyère that "Love comes all at once." Everything
in nature has a regular course, and different degrees of growth. Ah!
pray let me see some of your faults; be less beautiful, less gracious,
less tender, and, especially, less kind; above all never be jealous,
never weep; your tears madden me, fire my blood. Be sure that it is no
longer possible for me to have a thought except for you, or an idea of
which you shall not be the judge.

Have a good rest. Haste to get well. Come and join me, so that, at
least, before dying, we could say--"We were happy for so many days!!"

Millions of kisses, and even to Fortuné, in spite of his naughtiness.

  _Marmirolo, July 18, 1796_, 2 P.M.

I passed the whole night under arms. I ought to have had Mantua by a
plucky and fortunate coup; but the waters of the lake have suddenly
fallen, so that the column I had shipped could not land. This evening
I shall begin a new attempt, but one that will not give such
satisfactory results.

I got a letter from Eugène, which I send you. Please write for me to
these charming children of yours, and send them some trinkets. Be sure
to tell them that I love them as if they were my own. What is yours or
mine is so mixed up in my heart, that there is no difference there.

I am very anxious to know how you are, what you are doing? I have been
in the village of Virgil, on the banks of the lake, by the silvery
light of the moon, and not a moment without dreaming of Josephine.

The enemy made a general sortie on June 16th; it has killed or wounded
two hundred of our men, but lost five hundred of its own in a
precipitous retreat.

I am well. I am Josephine's entirely, and I have no pleasure or
happiness except in her society.

Three Neapolitan regiments have arrived at Brescia; they have sundered
themselves from the Austrian army, in consequence of the convention I
have concluded with M. Pignatelli.

I've lost my snuff-box; please choose me another, rather flat-shaped,
and write something pretty inside, with your own hair.

A thousand kisses as burning as you are cold. Boundless love, and
fidelity up to every proof. Before Joseph starts, I wish to speak to
him.

  BONAPARTE.


No. 4.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT MILAN.

  _Marmirolo, July 19, 1796._

I have been without letters from you for two days. That is at least
the thirtieth time to-day that I have made this observation to myself;
you are thinking this particularly wearisome; yet you cannot doubt
the tender and unique anxiety with which you inspire me.

We attacked Mantua yesterday. We warmed it up from two batteries with
red-hot shot and from mortars. All night long that wretched town has
been on fire. The sight was horrible and majestic. We have secured
several of the outworks; we open the first parallel to-night.
To-morrow I start for Castiglione with the Staff, and I reckon on
sleeping there. I have received a courier from Paris. There were two
letters for you; I have read them. But though this action appears to
me quite natural, and though you gave me permission to do so the other
day, I fear you may be vexed, and that is a great trouble to me. I
should have liked to have sealed them up again: fie! that would have
been atrocious. If I am to blame, I beg your forgiveness. I swear that
it is not because I am jealous; assuredly not. I have too high an
opinion of my beloved for that. I should like you to give me full
permission to read your letters, then there would be no longer either
remorse or apprehension.

Achille has just ridden post from Milan; no letters from my beloved!
Adieu, my unique joy. When will you be able to rejoin me? I shall have
to fetch you myself from Milan.

A thousand kisses as fiery as my soul, as chaste as yourself.

I have summoned the courier; he tells me that he crossed over to your
house, and that you told him you had no commands. Fie! naughty,
undutiful, cruel, tyrannous, jolly little monster. You laugh at my

  _Castiglione, July 21, 1796_, 8 A.M.

I am hoping that when I arrive to-night I shall get one of your
letters. You know, my dear Josephine, the pleasure they give me; and I
am sure you have pleasure in writing them. I shall start to-night for
Peschiera, for the mountains of ----, for Verona, and thence I shall
go to Mantua, and perhaps to Milan, to receive a kiss, since you
assure me they are not made of ice. I hope you will be perfectly well
by then, and will be able to accompany me to headquarters, so that we
may not part again. Are you not the soul of my life, and the
quintessence of my heart's affections?

Your protégés are a little excitable; they are like the will-o'-the-wisp.
How glad I am to do something for them which will please you. They will
go to Milan. A little patience is requisite in everything.

Adieu, _belle et bonne_, quite unequalled, quite divine. A thousand
loving kisses.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT MILAN.

  _Castiglione, July 22, 1796._

The needs of the army require my presence hereabouts; it is impossible
that I can leave it to come to Milan. Five or six days would be
necessary, and during that time movements may occur whereby my
presence here would be imperative.

You assure me your health is good; I beg you therefore to come to
Brescia. Even now I am sending Murat to prepare apartments for you
there in the town, as you desire.

I think you will do well to spend the first night (July 24th) at
Cassano, setting out very late from Milan; and to arrive at Brescia on
July 25th, where the most affectionate of lovers awaits you. I am
disconsolate that you can believe, dear, that my heart can reveal
itself to others as to you; it belongs to you by right of conquest,
and that conquest will be durable and for ever. I do not know why you
speak of Madame T., with whom I do not concern myself in the
slightest, nor with the women of Brescia. As to the letters which you
are vexed at my opening, this shall be the last; your letter had not
come.

Adieu, _ma tendre amie_, send me news often, come forthwith and join
me, and be happy and at ease; all goes well, and my heart is yours for
life.

Be sure to return to the Adjutant-General Miollis the box of medals
that he writes me he has sent you. Men have such false tongues, and
are so wicked, that it is necessary to have everything exactly on the
square.

Good health, love, and a prompt arrival at Brescia.

I have at Milan a carriage suitable alike for town or country; you can
make use of it for the journey. Bring your plate with you, and some of
the things you absolutely require.

Travel by easy stages, and during the coolth, so as not to tire
yourself. Troops only take three days coming to Brescia. Travelling
post it is only a fourteen hours' journey. I request you to sleep on
the 24th at Cassano; I shall come to meet you on the 25th at latest.

Adieu, my own Josephine. A thousand loving kisses.

thoughts the whole day. I shall be comfortable only when I have got
letters from you. I await them impatiently. You cannot possibly
imagine my uneasiness. I left you vexed, annoyed, and not well. If the
deepest and sincerest affection can make you happy, you ought to
be.... I am worked to death.

  _Brescia, August 31, 1796._

I start at once for Verona. I had hoped to get a letter from you; and
I am terribly uneasy about you. You were rather ill when I left; I beg
you not to leave me in such uneasiness. You promised me to be more
regular; and, at the time, your tongue was in harmony with your heart.
You, to whom nature has given a kind, genial, and wholly charming
disposition, how can you forget the man who loves you with so much
fervour? No letters from you for three days; and yet I have written to
you several times. To be parted is dreadful, the nights are long,
stupid, and wearisome; the day's work is monotonous.

This evening, alone with my thoughts, work and correspondence, with
men and their stupid schemes, I have not even one letter from you
which I might press to my heart.

The Staff has gone; I set off in an hour. To-night I get an express
from Paris; there was for you only the enclosed letter, which will
please you.

Think of me, live for me, be often with your well-beloved, and be sure
that there is only one misfortune that he is afraid of--that of being
no longer loved by his Josephine. A thousand kisses, very sweet, very
affectionate, very exclusive.

Send M. Monclas at once to Verona; I will find him a place. He must
get there before September 4th.

We are in the thick of the fight, my beloved; we have driven in the

like number of riders. My troops are good-humoured and in excellent
spirits. I hope that we shall do great things, and get into Trent by
the fifth.

No letters from you, which really makes me uneasy; yet they tell me
you are well, and have even had an excursion to Lake Como. Every day I
wait impatiently for the post which will bring me news of you--you
are well aware how I prize it. Far from you I cannot live, the
happiness of my life is near my gentle Josephine. Think of me! Write
me often, very often: in absence it is the only remedy: it is cruel,
but, I hope, will be only temporary.

deceive a poor husband, an affectionate lover. Ought he to lose his
rights because he is far away, up to the neck in business, worries and
anxiety. Without his Josephine, without the assurance of her love,
what in the wide world remains for him. What will he do?

Yesterday we had a very sanguinary conflict; the enemy has lost
heavily, and been completely beaten. We have taken from him the
suburbs of Mantua.

Adieu, charming Josephine; one of these nights the door will be burst
open with a bang, as if by a jealous husband, and in a moment I shall
be in your arms.

The day before yesterday I was out the whole day. Yesterday I kept my
bed. Fever and a racking headache both prevented me writing to my
beloved; but I got your letters. I have pressed them to my heart and
lips, and the grief of a hundred miles of separation has disappeared.
At the present moment I can see you by my side, not capricious and out
of humour, but gentle, affectionate, with that mellifluent kindness of
which my Josephine is the sole proprietor. It was a dream, judge if it
has cured my fever. Your letters are as cold as if you were fifty; we
might have been married fifteen years. One finds in them the
friendship and feelings of that winter of life. Fie! Josephine. It is
very naughty, very unkind, very undutiful of you. What more can you do
to make me indeed an object for compassion? Love me no longer? Eh,
that is already accomplished! Hate me? Well, I prefer that!
Everything grows stale except ill-will; but indifference, with its
marble pulse, its rigid stare, its monotonous demeanour!...

A thousand thousand very heartfelt kisses.

I am rather better. I start to-morrow. The English evacuate the

The enemy is beaten at Arcola. To-morrow we will repair Vaubois'
blunder of abandoning Rivoli. In a week Mantua will be ours, and
then your husband will clasp you in his arms, and give you a
thousand proofs of his ardent affection. I shall proceed to Milan as
soon as I can; I am rather tired. I have received letters from
Eugène and Hortense--charming young people. I will send them to
you as soon as I find my belongings, which are at present somewhat
dispersed.

We have made five thousand prisoners, and killed at least six thousand
of the enemy. Good-bye, my adored Josephine. Think of me often. If you
cease to love your Achilles, if for him your heart grows cold, you
will be very cruel, very unjust. But I am sure you will always remain
my faithful mistress, as I shall ever remain your fond lover. Death
alone can break the chain which sympathy, love, and sentiment have
forged. Let me have news of your health. A thousand and a thousand
kisses.

I don't love you an atom; on the contrary, I detest you. You are a

You never write to me; you don't care for your husband; you know the
pleasure your letters give him, and you write him barely half-a-dozen
lines, thrown off anyhow.

How, then, do you spend the livelong day, madam? What business of
such importance robs you of the time to write to your very kind lover?
What inclination stifles and alienates love, the affectionate and
unvarying love which you promised me? Who may this paragon be, this
new lover who engrosses all your time, is master of your days, and
prevents you from concerning yourself about your husband? Josephine,
be vigilant; one fine night the doors will be broken in, and I shall
be before you.

Truly, my dear, I am uneasy at getting no news from you. Write me four
pages immediately, and some of those charming remarks which fill my
heart with the pleasures of imagination.

I get to Milan; I fling myself into your room; I have left all in
order to see you, to clasp you in my arms.... You were not there. You
gad about the towns amid junketings; you run farther from me when I am
at hand; you care no longer for your dear Napoleon. A passing fancy
made you love him; fickleness renders him indifferent to you.

Used to perils, I know the remedy for weariness and the ills of life.
The ill-luck that I now suffer is past all calculations; I did right
not to anticipate it.

I shall be here till the evening of the 29th. Don't alter your plans;
have your fling of pleasure; happiness was invented for you. The whole
world is only too happy if it can please you, and only your husband is
very, very unhappy.

  _Milan_, _November 28, 1796_, 8 P.M.

I have received the courier whom Berthier had hurried on to Genoa. You
have not had time to write me, I feel it intuitively. Surrounded with
pleasures and pastimes, you would be wrong to make the least sacrifice
for me. Berthier has been good enough to show me the letter which you
wrote him. My intention is that you should not make the least change
in your plans, nor with respect to the pleasure parties in your
honour; I am of no consequence, either the happiness or the misery of
a man whom you don't love is a matter of no moment.

For my part, to love you only, to make you happy, to do nothing which
may vex you, that is the object and goal of my life.

Be happy, do not reproach me, do not concern yourself in the happiness
of a man who lives only in your life, rejoices only in your pleasure
and happiness. When I exacted from you a love like my own I was wrong;
why expect lace to weigh as heavy as gold? When I sacrifice to you all
my desires, all my thoughts, every moment of my life, I obey the sway
which your charms, your disposition, and your whole personality have
so effectively exerted over my unfortunate heart. I was wrong, since
nature has not given me attractions with which to captivate you; but
what I do deserve from Josephine is her regard and esteem, for I love
her frantically and uniquely.

Farewell, beloved wife; farewell, my Josephine. May fate concentrate
in my breast all the griefs and troubles, but may it give Josephine
happy and prosperous days. Who deserves them more? When it shall be
quite settled that she can love me no more, I will hide my profound
grief, and will content myself with the power of being useful and
serviceable to her.

I reopen my letter to give you a kiss.... Ah! Josephine!...

No. 1.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT PARIS.

  _Lausanne, May 15, 1800._

I have been at Lausanne since yesterday. I start to-morrow. My health
is fairly good. The country round here is very beautiful. I see no
reason why, in ten or twelve days, you should not join me here; you
must travel incognito, and not say where you are going, because I want
no one to know what I am about to do. You can say you are going to
Plombières.

I will send you Moustache,[16] who has just arrived.

My very kindest regards to Hortense. Eugène will not be here for eight
days; he is _en route_.

  BONAPARTE.


No. 2.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT PARIS.

  _Torre di Garofolo, May 16, 1800._

I start immediately to spend the night at Saint-Maurice. I have not
received a single letter from you; that is not well. I have written
you by every courier.

Eugène may arrive the day after to-morrow. I have rather a cold, but
it will have no ill effects.

My very kindest regards to you, my good little Josephine, and to all
who belong to you.

  BONAPARTE.

  _May 17th-19th.--At Martigny, "struggling against ice, snow-storms,
  and avalanches," and astonishing the great St. Bernard "with the
  passage of our 'pieces of 8,' and especially of our limbers--a new
  experience for it." On May 20th he climbed the St. Bernard on a
  mule, and descended it on a sledge. On May 21st he is at Aosta,
  hoping to be back in Paris within a fortnight. His army had passed
  the mountain in four days. On May 27th he is at Ivrea, taken by
  Lannes on the 24th._


No. 3.[17]

[_From Tennant's Tour, &c._, vol. ii.]

  11 P.M.

I hardly know which way to turn. In an hour I start for Vercelli.
Murat ought to be at Novaro to-night. The enemy is thoroughly
demoralised; he cannot even yet understand us. I hope within ten days
to be in the arms of my Josephine, who is always very good when she is
not crying and not flirting. Your son arrived this evening. I have had
him examined; he is in excellent health. Accept a thousand tender
thoughts. I have received M.'s letter. I will send her by the next
courier a box of excellent cherries.

We are here--within two months for Paris.--Yours entirely,

  N. B.

_To Madame Bonaparte._ (Address not in Bonaparte's writing.)

       *       *       *       *       *

  _June 1st._--First experiments with vaccination at Paris, with
  fluid sent from London.

  _On June 2nd Napoleon enters Milan, where he spends a week._


No. 4.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT PARIS.

  _Milan._

I am at Milan, with a very bad cold. I can't stand rain, and I have
been wet to the skin for several hours, but all goes well. I don't
persuade you to come here. I shall be home in a month. I trust to
find you flourishing. I am just starting for Pavia and Stradella. We
are masters of Brescia, Cremona, and Placentia.

Kindest regards. Murat has borne himself splendidly.

       *       *       *       *       *

  _June 5th._--Massena gives up Genoa, but leaves with all the
  honours of war.

  _June 7th._--Lannes takes Pavia, 350 cannon, and 10,000 muskets.

  _June 9th.--Battle of Montebello. Bonaparte defeats Austrians, who
  lose 8000 men._

  _June 14th.--Bonaparte wins Marengo, but loses Desaix--"the man I
  loved and esteemed the most." In his bulletin he admits the battle
  at one time was lost, until he cried to his troops "Children,
  remember it is my custom to sleep upon the battlefield." He
  mentions the charges of Desaix and Kellermann, and especially
  eulogises the latter--a fact interesting on account of the false
  statements made of his ignoring it. In the bulletin of June 21st
  he blames the "punic faith" of Lord Keith at Genoa, a criticism
  the Admiral repaid with usury fifteen years later._

  _June 14th._--Assassination of Kléber, in Egypt.

  _June 16th.--Convention of Alessandria between Bonaparte and

  Reserve, now united with the Army of Italy._

  _July 3rd.--The First Consul is back in Paris unexpectedly--not
  wishing triumphal arches or such-like "colifichets" In spite of
  which the plaudits he receives are very dear to him, "sweet as the
  voice of Josephine."_

  _September 5th._--Vaubois surrenders Malta to the English, after
  two years' blockade.

  _September 15th._--Armistice between France and Austria in
  Germany.

  _September 30th._--Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between

  loss, 16,000 men, 80 guns; French 3000).

  an infernal machine._

SERIES D

  "The peace of Amiens had always been regarded from the side of
  England as an armed truce: on the side of Napoleon it had a very
  different character.... A careful reader must admit that we were
  guilty of a breach of faith in not surrendering Malta. The promise
  of its surrender was the principal article of the treaty."

No. 1.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT PLOMBIÈRES.

  _Paris the "27" ..., 1801._

The weather is so bad here that I have remained in Paris. Malmaison,
without you, is too dreary. The fête has been a great success; it has
rather tired me. The blister they have put on my arm gives me constant
pain.

Some plants have come for you from London, which I have sent to your
gardener. If the weather is as bad at Plombières as it is here, you
will suffer severely from floods.

Best love to "Maman" and Hortense.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT PLOMBIÈRES.

  _Malmaison, June 19, 1802._

I have as yet received no news from you, but I think you must already
have begun to take the waters. It is rather dull for us here, although
your charming daughter does the honours of the house to perfection.
For the last two days I have suffered slightly from my complaint. The
fat Eugène arrived yesterday evening; he is very hale and hearty.

I love you as I did the first hour, because you are kind and sweet
beyond compare.

  BONAPARTE.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT PLOMBIÈRES.

  _Malmaison, June 23, 1802._

_My Good Little Josephine_,--Your letter has come. I am sorry to see
you have been poorly on the journey, but a few days' rest will put you
right. I am very fairly well. Yesterday I was at the Marly hunt, and
one of my fingers was very slightly injured whilst shooting a boar.

Hortense is usually in good health. Your fat son has been rather
unwell, but is getting better. I think the ladies are playing "The
Barber of Seville" to-night. The weather is perfect.

Rest assured that my truest wishes are ever for my little
Josephine.--Yours ever,

  BONAPARTE.


No. 4.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT PLOMBIÈRES.

  _Malmaison, June 27, 1802._

Your letter, dear little wife, has apprised me that you are out of
sorts. Corvisart tells me that it is a good sign that the baths are
having the desired effect, and that your health will soon be
re-established. But I am most truly grieved to know that you are in
pain.

Yesterday I went to see the Sèvres manufactory at St. Cloud.

Best wishes to all.--Yours for life,

  BONAPARTE.

       *       *       *       *       *

  _June 29th.--Pope withdraws excommunication from Talleyrand._


No. 5.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT PLOMBIÈRES.

  _Malmaison, July 1, 1802._

Your letter of June 29th has arrived. You say nothing of your health
nor of the effect of the baths. I see that you expect to be home in a
week; that is good news for your lover, who is tired of being alone!

You ought to have seen General Ney, who started for Plombières; he
will be married on his return.

Yesterday Hortense played Rosina in "The Barber of Seville" with her
usual skill.

Rest assured of my love, and that I await your return impatiently.
Without you everything here is dreary.

LETTERS OF THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON TO
THE EMPRESS JOSEPHINE DURING HIS
JOURNEY ALONG THE COAST, 1804.


EVENTS OF 1804.

  _February 15th._--The conspiracy of Pichegru. Moreau arrested,
  Pichegru (_February 28th_), and Georges Cadoudal (_March 9th_).

  _March 21st._--Duc D'Enghien shot at Vincennes.

  _April 6th._--Suicide of Pichegru.

No. 1.

TO THE EMPRESS JOSEPHINE.

  _Pont-de-Bricques, July 21, 1804._

_Madame and dear Wife_,--During the four days that I have been away
from you I have always been either on horseback or in a conveyance,
without any ill effect on my health.

M. Maret tells me that you intend starting on Monday; travelling by
easy stages, you can take your time and reach the Spa without tiring
yourself.

The wind having considerably freshened last night, one of our
gunboats, which was in the harbour, broke loose and ran on the
rocks about a league from Boulogne. I believed all lost--men and
merchandise; but we managed to save both. The spectacle was
grand: the shore sheeted in fire from the alarm guns, the sea
raging and bellowing, the whole night spent in anxiety to save
these unfortunates or to see them perish! My soul hovered between
eternity, the ocean, and the night. At 5 A.M. all was calm,
everything saved; and I went to bed with the feeling of having
had a romantic and epic dream--a circumstance which might have
reminded me that I was all alone, had weariness and soaked garments
left me any other need but that of sleep.

  NAPOLEON.

No. 2.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.

  _Boulogne, August 3, 1804._

_My Dear_,--I trust soon to learn that the waters have done you much
good. I am sorry to hear of all the vexations you have undergone.
Please write me often. My health is very good, although I am rather
tired. I shall be at Dunkirk in a very few days, and shall write you
from there.

Eugène has started for Blois.

  _Calais, August 6, 1804._

_My Dear_,--I arrived at Calais at midnight; I expect to start
to-night for Dunkirk. I am in very fair health, and satisfied with
what I see. I trust that the waters are doing you as much good as
exercise, camp, and seascape are doing me.

Eugène has set off for Blois. Hortense is well. Louis is at
Plombières.

I am longing to see you. You are always necessary to my happiness. My
very best love.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 4.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.

  _Ostend, August 14, 1804._

_My Dear_,--I have had no letter from you for several days; yet I
should be more comfortable if I knew that the waters were efficacious,
and how you spend your time. During the past week I have been at
Ostend. The day after to-morrow I shall be at Boulogne for a somewhat
special fête. Advise me by the courier what you intend to do, and how
soon you expect to end your baths.

I am very well satisfied with the army and the flotillas. Eugène is
still at Blois. I hear no more of Hortense than if she were on the
Congo. I am writing to scold her.

My best love to all.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 5.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.

  _Arras, Wednesday, August 29, 1804._

_Madame and dear Wife_,--I have just reached Arras. I shall stay
there to-morrow. I shall be at Mons on Friday, and on Sunday at
Aix-la-Chapelle. I am as well satisfied with my journey as with the
army. I think I shall pass through Brussels without stopping
there; thence I shall go to Maestricht. I am rather impatient to see
you. I am glad to hear you have tried the waters; they cannot fail
to do you good. My health is excellent. Eugène is well, and is with
me.

Very kindest regards to every one.

  BONAPARTE.

refuse to see him. Receive B---- only in general company, and do not
give him a private interview. Make promises to sign marriage contracts

  _May 26th.--Crowned at Milan._

  _June 8th.--Prince Eugène named Viceroy of Italy._

No. 1.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT STRASBURG.

  _Imperial Headquarters, Ettlingen_,

  _October 2, 1805_, 10 A.M.

I am well, and still here. I am starting for Stuttgard, where I shall
be to-night. Great operations are now in progress. The armies of
Wurtemberg and Baden have joined mine. I am well placed for the
campaign, and I love you.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 2.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT STRASBURG.

  _Louisbourg, October 4, 1805, Noon._

I am at Louisbourg. I start to-night. There is as yet nothing new. My
whole army is on the march. The weather is splendid. My junction with
the Bavarians is effected. I am well. I trust in a few days to have
something interesting to communicate.

Keep well, and believe in my entire affection. There is a brilliant
Court here, a new bride who is very beautiful, and upon the whole some
very pleasant people, even our Electress, who appears extremely kind,
although the daughter of the King of England.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 3.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT STRASBURG.

  _Louisbourg, October 5, 1805._

I continue my march immediately. You will, my dear, be five or six
days without hearing from me; don't be uneasy, it is connected with
operations now taking place. All goes well, and just as I could wish.

I have assisted at a marriage between the son of the Elector and a
niece of the King of Prussia. I wish to give the young princess a
wedding present to cost 36,000 to 40,000 francs. Please attend to
this, and send it to the bride by one of my chamberlains, when they
shall come to rejoin me. This matter must be attended to immediately.

Adieu, dear, I love you and embrace you.

  NAPOLEON.

TO JOSEPHINE, AT STRASBURG.

  _Augsbourg, Thursday, October 10, 1805_,

  11 A.M.

I slept last night[18] with the former Elector of Trèves, who is very
well lodged. For the past week I have been hurrying forward. The
campaign has been successful enough so far. I am very well, although
it rains almost every day. Events crowd on us rapidly. I have sent to
France 4000 prisoners, 8 flags, and have 14 of the enemy's cannon.

Adieu, dear, I embrace you.

No. 5.

  _October 12th.--French enter Munich._

TO JOSEPHINE, AT STRASBURG.

  _October 12, 1805_, 11 P.M.

My army has entered Munich. On one side the enemy is beyond the Inn; I
hold the other army, 60,000 strong, blocked on the Iller, between Ulm
and Memmingen. The enemy is beaten, has lost its head, and everything
points to a most glorious campaign, the shortest and most brilliant
which has been made. In an hour I start for Burgau-sur-l'Iller.

I am well, but the weather is frightful. It rains so much that I
change my clothes twice a day.

I love and embrace you.

  NAPOLEON.

  _October 14th.--Capture of Memmingen and 4OOO Austrians by
  Soult._

  _October 15th.--Battle of Elchingen. Ney defeats Laudon._

  _October 17th.--Capitulation of Ulm._


No. 6.

  _October 19th.--Werneck and 8000 men surrender to Murat._

TO JOSEPHINE, AT STRASBURG.

  _Abbaye d'Elchingen, October 19, 1805._

_My dear Josephine_,--I have tired myself more than I ought. Soaked
garments and cold feet every day for a week have made me rather ill,
but I have spent the whole of to-day indoors, which has rested me.

My design has been accomplished; I have destroyed the Austrian army by
marches alone; I have made 60,000 prisoners, taken 120 pieces of
cannon, more than 90 flags, and more than 30 generals. I am about to
fling myself on the Russians; they are lost men. I am satisfied with
my army. I have only lost 1500 men, of whom two-thirds are but
slightly wounded.

Prince Charles is on his way to cover Vienna. I think Massena should
be already at Vicenza.

The moment I can give my thoughts to Italy, I will make Eugène win a
battle.

Very best wishes to Hortense.

Adieu, my Josephine; kindest regards to every one.

  NAPOLEON.

       *       *       *       *       *

  _October 20th.--Mack and his army defile before Napoleon._


No. 7.

  _October 21st._--Battle of Trafalgar; Franco-Spanish fleet
  destroyed after a five hours' fight. "The result of the battle of
  Trafalgar compensates, for England, the results of the operations
  of Ulm. It has been justly observed that this power alone, of all
  those who fought France from 1793 to 1812, never experienced a
  check in her political or military combinations without seeing
  herself compensated forthwith by a signal success in some other
  part of the world" (_Montgaillard_).

TO THE EMPRESS, AT STRASBURG.

  _Elchingen, October 21, 1805, Noon._

I am fairly well, my dear. I start at once for Augsbourg. I have made
33,000 men lay down their arms, I have from 60,000 to 70,000
prisoners, more than 90 flags, and 200 pieces of cannon. Never has
there been such a catastrophe in military annals!

Take care of yourself. I am rather jaded. The weather has been fine
for the last three days. The first column of prisoners files off for
France to-day. Each column consists of 6000 men.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 8.

  _October 25th._--The Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia swear,
  at the tomb of the Great Frederick, to make implacable war on
  France (Convention signed November 3rd).

TO THE EMPRESS, AT STRASBURG.

  _Augsburg, October 25, 1805._

The two past nights have thoroughly rested me, and I am going to start
to-morrow for Munich. I am sending word to M. de Talleyrand and M.
Maret to be near at hand. I shall see something of them, and I am
going to advance upon the Inn in order to attack Austria in the heart
of her hereditary states. I should much have liked to see you; but do
not reckon upon my sending for you, unless there should be an
armistice or winter quarters.

Adieu, dear; a thousand kisses. Give my compliments to the ladies.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 9.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT STRASBURG.

  _Munich, Sunday, October 27, 1805._

I received your letter per Lemarois. I was grieved to see how
needlessly you have made yourself unhappy. I have heard particulars
which have proved how much you love me, but you should have more
fortitude and confidence. Besides, I had advised you that I should be
six days without writing you.

To-morrow I expect the Elector. At noon I start to support my advance
on the Inn. My health is fair. You need not think of crossing the
Rhine for two or three weeks. You must be cheerful, amuse yourself,
and hope that before the end of the month[19] we shall meet.

I am advancing against the Russian army. In a few days I shall have
crossed the Inn.

Adieu, my dear; kindest regards to Hortense, Eugène, and the two
Napoleons.

Keep back the wedding present a little longer.

Yesterday I gave a concert to the ladies of this court. The precentor
is a superior man.

I took part in the Elector's pheasant-shoot; you see by that that I am
not so tired. M. de Talleyrand has come.

  NAPOLEON.

       *       *       *       *       *

  disastrous to their arms.


No. 10.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT STRASBURG.

  _Haag, November 3, 1805_, 10 P.M.

I am in full march; the weather is very cold, the earth covered with a
foot of snow. This is rather trying. Luckily there is no want of wood;
here we are always in forests. I am fairly well. My campaign proceeds
satisfactorily; my enemies must have more anxieties than I.

I wish to hear from you and to learn that you are not worrying
yourself.

Adieu, dear; I am going to lie down.

  NAPOLEON.

       *       *       *       *       *

  _November 4th._--Combat of Amstetten. Lannes and Murat drive back
  the Russians. Davoust occupies Steyer. Army of Italy takes
  Vicenza.


No. 11.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT STRASBURG.

  _Tuesday, November 5, 1805._

I am at Lintz. The weather is fine. We are within seventy miles of
Vienna. The Russians do not stand; they are in full retreat. The house
of Austria is at its wit's end, and in Vienna they are removing all
the court belongings. It is probable that something new will occur
within five or six days. I much desire to see you again. My health is
good.

I embrace you.

  Russians, but saved by Dupont.

  _November 13th._--Vienna entered and bridge over the Danube
  seized. Massena crosses the Tagliamento.

  _November 14th._--Ney enters Trent.


No. 12.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT STRASBURG.

  _November 15, 1805_, 9 P.M.

I have been at Vienna two days, my dear, rather fagged. I have not yet
seen the city by day; I have traversed it by night. To-morrow I
receive the notables and public bodies. Nearly all my troops are
beyond the Danube, in pursuit of the Russians.

Adieu, Josephine; as soon as it is possible I will send for you. My
very best love.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 13.

  _November 16th._--Jellachich surrenders to Augereau at Feldkirch
  with 7000 men.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT STRASBURG.

  _Vienna, November 16, 1805._

I am writing to M. d'Harville, so that you can set out and make your
way to Baden, thence to Stuttgard, and from there to Munich. At
Stuttgard you will give the wedding present to the Princess Paul. If
it costs fifteen to twenty thousand francs, that will suffice; the
rest will do for giving presents at Munich to the daughters of the
Electress of Bavaria. All that Madame de Serent[20] has advised you is
definitely arranged. Take with you the wherewithal to make presents to
the ladies and officers who will wait upon you. Be civil, but receive
full homage; they owe everything to you, and you owe nothing save
civility. The Electress of Wurtemberg is daughter of the King of
England. She is an excellent woman; you should be very kind to her,
but yet without affectation.

I shall be very glad to see you, the moment circumstances permit me. I
start to join my vanguard. The weather is frightful; it snows heavily.
Otherwise my affairs go excellently.

Adieu, my dear.

  _Austerlitz, December 3, 1805._

I have despatched to you Lebrun from the field of battle. I have
beaten the Russian and Austrian army commanded by the two Emperors. I
am rather fagged. I have bivouacked eight days in the open air,
through nights sufficiently keen. To-night I rest in the château of
Prince Kaunitz, where I shall sleep for the next two or three hours.
The Russian army is not only beaten, but destroyed.

I embrace you.

  compliment dont la fortune a changé l'addresse."_


No. 15.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MUNICH.

  _Austerlitz, December 5, 1805._

I have concluded a truce. The Russians have gone. The battle of
Austerlitz is the grandest of all I have fought. Forty-five flags,
more than 150 pieces of cannon, the standards of the Russian Guard, 20
generals, 30,000 prisoners, more than 20,000 slain--a horrible sight.

The Emperor Alexander is in despair, and on his way to Russia.
Yesterday, at my bivouac, I saw the Emperor of Germany. We conversed
for two hours; we have agreed to make peace quickly.

The weather is not now very bad. At last behold peace restored to the
Continent; it is to be hoped that it is going to be to the world. The
English will not know how to face us.

I look forward with much pleasure to the moment when I can once more
be near you. My eyes have been rather bad the last two days; I have
never suffered from them before.

Adieu, my dear. I am fairly well, and very anxious to embrace you.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 16.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MUNICH.

  _Austerlitz, December 7, 1805._

I have concluded an armistice; within a week peace will be made. I am
anxious to hear that you reached Munich in good health. The Russians
are returning; they have lost enormously--more than 20,000 dead and
30,000 taken. Their army is reduced by three-quarters. Buxhowden,
their general-in-chief, was killed. I have 3000 wounded and 700 to 800
dead.

My eyes are rather bad; it is a prevailing complaint, and scarcely
worth mentioning.

Adieu, dear. I am very anxious to see you again.

I am going to sleep to-night at Vienna.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 17.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MUNICH.

  _Brunn, December 10, 1805._

It is a long time since I had news of you. Have the grand fêtes at
Baden, Stuttgard, and Munich made you forget the poor soldiers, who
live covered with mud, rain, and blood?

I shall start in a few days for Vienna.

We are endeavouring to conclude peace. The Russians have gone, and are
in flight far from here; they are on their way back to Russia, well
drubbed and very much humiliated.

I am very anxious to be with you again.

Adieu, dear.

My bad eyes are cured.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MUNICH.

  _December 19, 1805._

_Great Empress_,--Not a single letter from you since your departure
from Strasburg. You have gone to Baden, Stuttgard, Munich, without
writing us a word. This is neither very kind nor very affectionate.

I am still at Brunn. The Russians are gone. I have a truce. In a few
days I shall see what I may expect. Deign from the height of your
grandeur to concern yourself a little with your slaves.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MUNICH.

  _Schönbrunn, December 20, 1805._

I got your letter of the 16th. I am sorry to learn you are in pain.
You are not strong enough to travel two hundred and fifty miles at
this time of the year. I know not what I shall do; I await events. I
have no will in the matter; everything depends on their issue. Stay at
Munich; amuse yourself. That is not difficult when you have so many
kind friends and so beautiful a country. I, for my part, am
sufficiently busy. In a few days my decision will be made.

Adieu, dear. Kindest and most affectionate regards.

  France (germ of Spanish War)._

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _October 5, 1806._

It will be quite in order for the Princess of Baden to come to
Mayence. I cannot think why you weep; you do wrong to make yourself
ill. Hortense is inclined to pedantry; she loves to air her views. She
has written me; I am sending her a reply. She ought to be happy and
cheerful. Pluck and a merry heart--that's the recipe.

Adieu, dear. The Grand Duke has spoken to me about you; he saw you at
Florence at the time of the retreat.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 2.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _Bamberg, October 7, 1806._

I start this evening, my dear, for Cronach. The whole of my army is
advancing. All goes well. My health is perfect. I have only received
as yet one letter from you. I have some from Eugène and from Hortense.
Stephanie should now be with you. Her husband wishes to make the
campaign; he is with me.

Adieu. A thousand kisses and the best of health.

No. 3.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _Gera_, _October 13, 1806_, 2 A.M.

_My Dear_,--I am at Gera to-day. My affairs go excellently well, and
everything as I could wish. With the aid of God, they will, I believe,
in a few days have taken a terrible course for the poor King of
Prussia, whom I am sorry for personally, because he is a good man.
The Queen is at Erfurt with the King. If she wants to see a battle,
she shall have that cruel pleasure. I am in splendid health. I have
already put on flesh since my departure; yet I am doing, in person,
twenty and twenty-five leagues a day, on horseback, in my carriage, in
all sorts of ways. I lie down at eight, and get up at midnight. I
fancy at times that you have not yet gone to bed.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.

  _Jena_, _October 15, 1806_, 3 A.M.

_My Dear_,--I have made excellent manoeuvres against the Prussians.
Yesterday I won a great victory. They had 150,000 men. I have made
20,000 prisoners, taken 100 pieces of cannon, and flags. I was in
presence of the King of Prussia, and near to him; I nearly captured
him and the Queen. For the past two days I have bivouacked. I am in
excellent health.

Adieu, dear. Keep well, and love me.

If Hortense is at Mayence, give her a kiss; also to Napoleon and to
the little one.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 5.

  _October 16th.--Soult routs Kalkreuth at Greussen; Erfurt and
  16,000 men capitulate to Murat._

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _Weimar_, _October 16, 1806_, 5 P.M.

M. Talleyrand will have shown you the bulletin, my dear; you will see
my successes therein. All has happened as I calculated, and never was
an army more thoroughly beaten and more entirely destroyed. I need
only add that I am very well, and that fatigue, bivouacs, and
night-watches have made me fat.

Adieu, dear. Kindest regards to Hortense and to the great M.
Napoleon.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.

  _Wittenberg, October 23, 1806, Noon._

I have received several of your letters. I write you only a line. My
affairs prosper. To-morrow I shall be at Potsdam, and at Berlin on the
25th. I am wonderfully well, and thrive on hard work. I am very glad
to hear you are with Hortense and Stephanie, _en grande compagnie_. So
far, the weather has been fine.

Kind regards to Stephanie, and to everybody, not forgetting M.
Napoleon.

Adieu, dear.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.


No. 7.

  _October 24th.--Lannes occupies Potsdam._

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _Potsdam, October 24, 1806._

_My Dear_,--I have been at Potsdam since yesterday, and shall remain
there to-day. I continue satisfied with my undertakings. My health is
good; the weather very fine. I find Sans-Souci very pleasant.

Adieu, dear. Best wishes to Hortense and to M. Napoleon.

  Becker._

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _November 1, 1806_, 2 A.M.

Talleyrand has just arrived and tells me, my dear, that you do nothing
but cry. What on earth do you want? You have your daughter, your
grandchildren, and good news; surely these are sufficient reasons for
being happy and contented.

The weather here is superb; there has not yet fallen during the whole
campaign a single drop of water. I am very well, and all goes
excellently.

Adieu, dear; I have received a letter from M. Napoleon; I do not
believe it is from him, but from Hortense. Kindest regards to
everybody.

No. 9.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _Berlin, November 2, 1806._

Your letter of October 26th to hand. We have splendid weather here.
You will see by the bulletin that we have taken Stettin--it is a very
strong place. All my affairs go as well as possible, and I am
thoroughly satisfied. One pleasure is alone wanting--that of seeing
you, but I hope that will not long be deferred.

Kindest regards to Hortense, Stephanie, and to the little Napoleon.

Adieu, dear.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.


No. 9A.

From the Memoirs of Mademoiselle d'Avrillon (vol. i. 128).

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _Berlin, Monday, Noon._

_My Dear_,--I have received your letter. I am glad to know that you
are in a place which pleases me, and especially to know that you are
very well there. Who should be happier than you? You should live
without a worry, and pass your time as pleasantly as possible; that,
indeed, is my intention.

I forbid you to see Madame Tallien, under any pretext whatever. I will
admit of no excuse. If you desire a continuance of my esteem, if you
wish to please me, never transgress the present order. She may
possibly come to your apartments, to enter them by night; forbid your
porter to admit her.

       *       *       *       *       *

I shall soon be at Malmaison. I warn you to have no lovers there that
night; I should be sorry to disturb them. Adieu, dear; I long to see
you and assure you of my love and affection.

  NAPOLEON.


No. 10.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _November 6, 1806_, 9 P.M.

Yours to hand, in which you seem annoyed at the bad things I say about
women; it is true that I hate intriguing women more than anything. I
am used to kind, gentle, persuasive women; these are the kind I like.
If I have been spoilt, it is not my fault, but yours. Moreover, you
shall learn how kind I have been to one who showed herself sensible
and good, Madame d'Hatzfeld. When I showed her husband's letter to her
she admitted to me, amid her sobs, with profound emotion, and frankly,
"Ah! it is indeed his writing!" While she was reading, her voice went
to my heart; it pained me. I said, "Well, madame, throw that letter on
the fire, I shall then have no longer the power to punish your
husband." She burnt the letter, and seemed very happy. Her husband now
feels at ease; two hours later he would have been a dead man. You see
then how I like kind, frank, gentle women; but it is because such
alone resemble you.

Adieu, dear; my health is good.

  NAPOLEON.

  _November 6th and 7th.--Blucher and his army (17,000 men)
  surrender at Lubeck to Soult, Murat, and Bernadotte._

  _November 8th.--Magdeburg surrenders to Ney, with 20,000 men,
  immense stores, and nearly 800 cannon._


No. 11.

  _November 9th.--Napoleon levies a contribution of 150 million
  francs on Prussia and her allies._

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _Berlin, November 9, 1806._

_My Dear_,--I am sending good news. Magdeburg has capitulated, and on
November 7th I took 20,000 men at Lubeck who escaped me last week. The
whole Prussian army, therefore, is captured; even beyond the Vistula
there does not remain to Prussia 20,000 men. Several of my army corps
are in Poland. I am still at Berlin. I am very fairly well.

Adieu, dear; heartiest good wishes to Hortense, Stephanie, and the two
little Napoleons.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.

No. 12.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _Berlin, November 16, 1806._

I received your letter of November 11th. I note with satisfaction that
my convictions give you pleasure. You are wrong to think flattery was
intended; I was telling you of yourself as I see you. I am grieved to
think that you are tired of Mayence. Were the journey less long, you
might come here, for there is no longer an enemy, or, if there is, he
is beyond the Vistula; that is to say, more than three hundred miles
away. I will wait to hear what you think about it. I should also be
delighted to see M. Napoleon.

Adieu, my dear.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.

I have still too much business here for me to return to Paris.

TO THE EMPRESS, AT MAYENCE.

  _November 22, 1806_, 10 P.M.

Your letter received. I am sorry to find you in the dumps; yet you
have every reason to be cheerful. You are wrong to show so much
kindness to people who show themselves unworthy of it. Madame L----
is a fool; such an idiot that you ought to know her by this time, and
pay no heed to her. Be contented, happy in my friendship, and in the
great influence you possess. In a few days I shall decide whether to
summon you hither or send you to Paris.

Adieu, dear; you can go at once, if you like, to Darmstadt, or to
Frankfort; that will make you forget your troubles.

Kindest regards to Hortense.

I am at Kustrin, making a tour and spying out the land a little; I
shall see in a day or two whether you should come. You can keep ready.
I shall be very pleased if the Queen of Holland be of the party. The
Grand Duchess of Baden must write to her husband about it.

It is 2 A.M. I am just getting up; it is the usage of war.

Kindest regards to you and to every one.

I am about to make a tour in Poland. This is the first town there.
To-night I shall be at Posen, after which I shall send for you to come
to Berlin, so that you can arrive there the same day as I. My health
is good, the weather rather bad; it has rained for the past three
days. My affairs prosper. The Russians are in flight.

Adieu, dear; kindest regards to Hortense, Stephanie, and the little
Napoleons.

To-day is the anniversary of Austerlitz. I have been to a city ball.
It is raining; I am in good health. I love you and long for you. My
troops are at Warsaw. So far the cold has not been severe. All these
fair Poles are Frenchwomen at heart; but there is only one woman
for me. Would you know her? I could draw her portrait very well;
but I should have to flatter it too much for you to recognise
yourself;--yet, to tell the truth, my heart would only have nice
things to say to you. These nights are long, all alone.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.

_December 3, 1806, Noon._

Yours of November 26th received. I notice two things in it. You say I
do not read your letters: it is an unkind thought. I take your bad
opinion anything but kindly. You tell me that perhaps it is a mere
phantasy of the night, and you add that you are not jealous. I found
out long ago that angry persons always assert that they are not angry;
that those who are afraid keep on repeating that they have no fear;
you therefore are convinced of jealousy. I am delighted to hear it!
Nevertheless, you are wrong; I think of nothing less, and in the
desert plains of Poland one thinks little about beauties....

I had yesterday a ball of the provincial nobility--the women
good-looking enough, rich enough, dowdy enough, although in Paris
fashions.

Adieu, dear; I am in good health.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.

  _Posen, December 3, 1806_, 6 P.M.

Yours of November 27th received, from which I see that your little
head is quite turned. I am reminded of the verse--

  "Désir de femme est un feu qui dévore."

Still you must calm yourself. I wrote you that I was in Poland; that,
when we were established in winter quarters, you could come; you will
have to wait a few days. The greater one becomes, the less one can
consult one's wishes--being dependent on events and circumstances. You
can come to Frankfort or Darmstadt. I am hoping to send for you in a
few days; that is, if circumstances will permit. The warmth of your
letter makes me realise that you, like other pretty women, know no
bounds. What you will, must be; but, as for me, I declare that of all
men I am the greatest slave; my master has no pity, and this master is
the nature of things.

Adieu, dear; keep well. The person that I wished to speak to you about
is Madame L----, of whom every one is speaking ill; they assure me
that she is more Prussian than French woman. I don't believe it, but I
think her an idiot who talks nothing but trash.

Yours of December 1st received. I see with pleasure that you are more

give the order; but you must still wait a few days. My affairs
prosper.

Adieu, dear; I love you and wish to see you happy.

health. The weather is very changeable. My affairs prosper pretty
well. I love you and long for you much.

Adieu, dear; I shall write for you to come with at least as much
pleasure as you will have in coming.--Yours ever,

_My Dear_,--I have not received any letters from you, but know,
nevertheless, that you are well. My health is good, the weather very
mild; the bad season has not begun yet, but the roads are bad in a
country where there are no highways. Hortense will come then with
Napoleon; I am delighted to hear it. I long to see things shape
themselves into a position to enable you to come.

I have made peace with Saxony. The Elector is King and one of the
confederation.

Adieu, my well-beloved Josephine.--Yours ever,

should be very glad if you would return to Paris, where you are
wanted. You well know that I am dependent on events. All my affairs go
excellently. My health is very good; I am as well as possible.

even somewhat humid. It has as yet barely begun to freeze; it is
October weather.

Adieu, dear; I should much have liked to see you, but trust that in
five or six days I shall be able to send for you.

Kindest regards to the Queen of Holland and to her little
Napoleons.--Yours ever,

I write you only a line, my dear. I am in a wretched barn. I have
beaten the Russians, taken thirty pieces of cannon, their baggage,
and 6000 prisoners; but the weather is frightful. It is raining; we
have mud up to our knees.

In two days I shall be at Warsaw, whence I shall write you.--Yours
ever,

  _Pultusk, December 31, 1806._

I have had a good laugh over your last letters. You idealise the fair
ones of Great Poland in a way they do not deserve. I have had for two
or three days the pleasure of hearing Päer and two lady singers, who
have given me some very good music. I received your letter in a
wretched barn, having mud, wind, and straw for my only bed. To-morrow
I shall be at Warsaw. I think all is over for this year. The army is
entering winter quarters. I shrug my shoulders at the stupidity of
Madame de L----; still you should show her your displeasure, and
counsel her not to be so idiotic. Such things become common property,
and make many people indignant.

For my part, I scorn ingratitude as the worst fault in a human heart.
I know that instead of comforting you, these people have given you
pain.

Adieu, dear; I am in good health. I do not think you ought to go to
Cassel; that place is not suitable. You may go to Darmstadt.

  _Warsaw, January 3, 1807._

_My Dear_,--I have received your letter. Your grief pains me; but one
must bow to events. There is too much country to travel between
Mayence and Warsaw; you must, therefore, wait till circumstances
allow me to come to Berlin, in order that I may write you to come
thither. It is true that the enemy, defeated, is far away; but I have
many things here to put to rights. I should be inclined to think that
you might return to Paris, where you are needed. Send away those
ladies who have their affairs to look after; you will be better
without people who have given you so much worry.

My health is good; the weather bad. I love you from my heart.

  _Warsaw, January 7, 1807._

_My Dear_,--I am pained by all that you tell me; but the season being
cold, the roads very bad and not at all safe, I cannot consent to
expose you to so many fatigues and dangers. Return to Paris in order
to spend the winter there. Go to the Tuileries; receive, and lead the
same life as you are accustomed to do when I am there; that is my
wish. Perhaps I shall not be long in rejoining you there; but it is
absolutely necessary for you to give up the idea of making a journey
of 750 miles at this time of the year, through the enemy's country,
and in the rear of the army. Believe that it costs me more than you to
put off for some weeks the pleasure of seeing you, but so events and
the success of my enterprise order it.

Adieu, my dear; be cheerful, and show character.

  _Warsaw, January 8, 1807._

_My Dear_,--I received your letter of the 27th with those of M.
Napoleon and Hortense, which were enclosed with it. I had begged you
to return to Paris. The season is too inclement, the roads unsafe and
detestable; the distances too great for me to permit you to come
hither, where my affairs detain me. It would take you at least a month
to come. You would arrive ill; by that time it might perhaps be
necessary to start back again; it would therefore be folly. Your
residence at Mayence is too dull; Paris reclaims you; go there, it is
my wish. I am more vexed about it than you. I should have liked to
spend the long nights of this season with you, but we must obey
circumstances.

Adieu, dear.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.

Your letter of the 27th received, from which I note that you are
somewhat uneasy about military events. Everything is settled, as I
have told you, to my satisfaction; my affairs prosper. The distance is
too great for me to allow you to come so far at this time of year. I
am in splendid health, sometimes rather wearied by the length of the
nights.

Up to the present I have seen few people here.

Adieu, dear. I wish you to be cheerful, and to give a little life to
the capital. I would much like to be there.--Yours ever,

  NAPOLEON.

I hope that the Queen has gone to the Hague with M. Napoleon.

MY DEAR,--I have received your letter of the 5th of January; all that
you tell me of your unhappiness pains me. Why these tears, these
repinings? Have you then no longer any fortitude? I shall see you
soon. Never doubt my feelings; and if you wish to be still dearer to
me, show character and strength of mind. I am humiliated to think that
my wife can distrust my destinies.

Adieu, dear. I love you, I long to see you, and wish to learn that you
are content and happy.

I fear that you are greatly grieved at our separation and at your
return to Paris, which must last for some weeks longer. I insist on
your having more fortitude. I hear you are always weeping. Fie! how
unbecoming it is! Your letter of January 7th makes me unhappy. Be
worthy of me; assume more character. Cut a suitable figure at Paris;
and, above all, be contented.

I am very well, and I love you much; but, if you are always crying, I
shall think you without courage and without character. I do not love
cowards. An empress ought to have fortitude.

  NAPOLEON.
